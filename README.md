# galaga
galaga/lmkb "light metal keyboard"(mk 1, 2, 3): negative angle; stabless=caps 1.75U and smaller; initially was made to be kitted with most of DMK/JTK keycap sets; case is lasercut, then bent-at-home; handwire; "omega stagger"; after trials- would recommend G20 caps instead of cherry profiles (primarily vertical "cherry" can be pretty uncomfortable).
