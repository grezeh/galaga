# galaga
galaga/lmkb (mk 1, 2, 3) keyboard: negative angle; stabless=caps 1.75U and smaller; initially was made to be kitted with most of DMK/JTK keycap sets; (lmkb=light metal keyboard); case is bent-at-home-diy; handwire; "omega stagger"; after trials- would recommend G20 caps instead of cherry profiles (primarily vertical "cherry" can be pretty uncomfortable). Galaga mk3 is still waiting on better weather to be painted.
